Privacy Policy for RajPay Calc
Effective Date: February 20, 2026

RajPay Calc (the "App") is a utility application designed to help Rajasthan Government employees calculate their estimated salary. This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App.

1. Information Collection and Use
We do NOT collect, store, or share any personal information.

Local Calculation: All salary calculations are performed locally on your device. The data you input (such as basic pay, department, or allowances) never leaves your device and is not stored on any external servers.
No Personal Identifiable Information (PII): We do not ask for your name, email address, phone number, or any other identification details.
2. Permissions
The App requires minimal permissions to function:

Internet Access: Used solely for checking for app updates or loading external fonts/libraries (if applicable).
No Sensitive Permissions: We do not access your location, camera, microphone, contacts, or storage files.
3. Third-Party Services
The App may use third-party libraries (like Expo or React Native) to ensure a smooth user experience. These libraries do not collect personal data through our App. We do not use any tracking or analytics services (like Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel).

4. Log Data
We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app, we do not collect data and information on your phone.

5. Cookies
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. This App does not use "cookies" explicitly.

6. Security
We value your trust in using our App. Since the App does not collect any personal data, your privacy is protected by design. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable.

7. Children’s Privacy
Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

9. Disclaimer
The calculations provided by RajPay Calc are for informational and estimation purposes only. Users are advised to verify their final salary with the official Rajasthan Government Pay Department or their respective DDO (Drawing and Disbursing Officer).
